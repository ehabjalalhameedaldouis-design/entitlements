The first Flutter project.
The main idea of the appliaction is to manage the debts you have or owe.

First of all,the application is built on the Flutter framework in the Dart language.
The app is very easy to use and its interface is also easy to use.

The app contains three interfaces:
  1- All clients:
    all debts owned to you or by you are displayed.
  2- Payables:  
    all debts owned by you are displayed.
  3- Receivables:  
    all debts owned to you are displayed.



The application works completely offline and the data is stored using the hive library on your phone, so if the application is deleted, all the data will disappear.
